# Cursor Rules for my-design-learning Project

## Git Commit Rules

When helping with Git commits in this project, ALWAYS follow these rules from COMMIT_RULES.md:

### Commit Message Format

**Structure:**
```
<type>: <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Rules:**
1. **Subject Line**: 
   - Capitalized, short summary (50 characters or less)
   - Use imperative mood: "Add component" not "Added component" or "Adds component"
   - No period at the end
   - Must start with a type prefix

2. **Blank Line**: Always leave the second line blank

3. **Body** (optional but recommended):
   - Wrap text to about 72 characters
   - Explain what and why, not how
   - Use imperative mood
   - Can use bullet points (hyphen or asterisk)

### Commit Types

Use these prefixes:
- `feat`: A new feature (component, section, functionality)
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `style`: Changes that don't affect code meaning (formatting, CSS, whitespace)
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `chore`: Changes to build process, dependencies, or tooling
- `ui`: UI/UX improvements (styling, layout, visual changes)

### Commit Principles

1. **Commit Related Changes Only**: One logical change per commit
   - ✅ Good: One commit for adding a component, another for fixing a bug
   - ❌ Bad: One commit that adds a component AND fixes a bug AND updates styles

2. **Commit Often**: Keep commits small and focused

3. **Don't Commit Half-Done Work**: Only commit when a logical component is completed

4. **Test Before Committing**: Ensure code works and TypeScript compiles

### Vue Component Commit Patterns

- **New component**: `feat: add ComponentName component`
- **Component update**: `feat: enhance ComponentName with [feature]`
- **Component fix**: `fix: [issue] in ComponentName`
- **Component styling**: `ui: improve ComponentName styling`

### Examples

**Simple feature:**
```
feat: add Testimonials component with horizontal scroll
```

**Feature with description:**
```
feat: enhance ImpressionItem with badges and icons overlay

- Add sale badge overlay on product image
- Add interactive icons (heart, cart, eye) at bottom of image
- Improve layout with better spacing and typography
```

**Bug fix:**
```
fix: center icon container in ImpressionItem

The icon container was not properly centered horizontally.
Added -translate-x-1/2 to center the flex container relative
to its left-1/2 position.
```

**UI improvement:**
```
ui: improve Testimonials scroll behavior

- Add overflow-x-scroll for horizontal scrolling
- Add flex-shrink-0 to prevent items from shrinking
```

### When Creating Commits

- Always suggest commit messages following this format
- When user asks to commit multiple files, suggest separate commits for unrelated changes
- Remind to test code before committing
- Use imperative mood in all commit messages
- Keep subject line under 50 characters
- Always include a blank line after the subject if there's a body

### Project Context

This is a Vue 3 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS project. Components are in `src/components/`. When committing:
- One commit per component creation
- Separate commits for styling improvements
- Separate commits for functionality additions
- Commit each modified file separately when possible, unless files are closely related
